# My-Final-Year-Project

This project is just showing what I did in school in 2024-25 Academic Year. The project title is UWB RTLS with TFLM. I got A grade in this course. Whole firmware development is completed by Keil.

## Ultra-wide Band (UWB)

A technology used for Real Time Location System (RTLS), Qorvo DW1000 is used in my project. The most well-know product with this technology is [AirTag](https://www.apple.com/airtag/) (U1 chip)

## [TensorFlow Lite for Microcontroller](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/microcontrollers/overview) (TFLM)

A TinyML that can be implemented in small MCU.
